          I've been building software and developing websites for over 5 years and absolutely love seeing ideas go from concept to production and the creative problem-solving that brings. I'm driven by the impact great software can have, whether it's making someone's workflow smoother, helping a team make better decisions, or just creating a delightfully smooth user experience. I enjoy diving into complex codebases, finding elegant solutions to messy problems and I have always loved a good bug hunt! üêõ

          I'm currently looking for a new full time opportunity, and in the mean time I'm doing some freelance web development, volunteering as a React developer for an organization researching whole brain emulation and conducting interviews for the Recurse Center, a wonderful programming retreat where curious programmers come together to become dramatically better in a short space of time.
